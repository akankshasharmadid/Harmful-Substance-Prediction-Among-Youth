## Abstarct


It is fair to assume that the parental involvement, education, and religion beliefs affect the outcome on how child will perceive the use of harmful substance later in their life. This research, based on the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), aims to predict alcohol consumption among youth using behavioral factors and variables such as religious beliefs, parent-child relationship, academic factors, and participation in self-esteem and problem-solving groups were analyzed. The study highlights the importance of family and community support in reducing harmful behaviors among youth. Decision tree models were employed in this study to anticipate the behavior of young people in terms of consuming alcohol later in life. Additionally, the research expands to predicting the age at which young people will have their first encounter with alcohol.

## Introduction:  

 
Alcohol consumption among youth is a significant public health concern with potentially harmful consequences for both individuals and society. In this study, we aim to predict alcohol consumption among youth using data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). The NSDUH is an annual survey that collects data on substance use and related behaviors among individuals aged 12 years and older in the United States. Our attention is directed towards various factors such as religious convictions, the dynamic between parents and their children, academic performance, and engagement in groups aimed at improving self-esteem and problem-solving abilities. By analyzing these factors, we hope to identify potential risk and protective factors that could inform prevention and intervention efforts to reduce alcohol consumption among youth.
